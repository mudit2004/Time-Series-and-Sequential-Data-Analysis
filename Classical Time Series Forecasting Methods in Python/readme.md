# Classical Time Series Forecasting Methods in Python

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating classical time series forecasting methods. These methods can be used for forecasting on time series problems, often prior to exploring more complex machine learning methods. 

## Methods Covered

1. Autoregression (AR)
2. Moving Average (MA)
3. Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
4. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
5. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA)
6. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX)
7. Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
8. Holt Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing (HWES)
9. Vector Autoregression (VAR)
10. Vector Autoregression Moving-Average (VARMA)
11. Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX)

## Usage

Each code example is demonstrated on a simple contrived dataset that may or may not be appropriate for the method. Replace the contrived dataset with your data in order to test the method. 

Remember: each method will require tuning to your specific problem.
