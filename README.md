# Time Series and Sequential Data Analysis

This repository contains code and materials related to the Time Series and Sequential Data Analysis lab, completed during the 3rd year of college.

## Overview

In this lab, we explore various techniques and algorithms for analyzing time-series data and sequential data. Time-series analysis is crucial in many domains, including finance, weather forecasting, and signal processing, among others. Understanding sequential data is also essential in natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other applications.
