# Time Series and Data Analysis Experiment

This repository contains the materials and documentation for an experiment conducted on the subject of Time Series and Data Analysis in a college laboratory.

## Experiment Overview

The experiment focuses on understanding various characteristics of time series data and how to analyze them effectively. Key aspects covered in the experiment include:

- Checking stationarity, trend, and seasonality of the given data.
- Understanding autocorrelation and its significance.
- Identifying and handling seasonality in time series data.
- Recognizing the importance of stationarity in time series modeling.
- Implementing statistical tests to determine stationarity.

## Experiment Details

### Stationarity, Trend, and Seasonality

The experiment starts with an introduction to time series data and the importance of stationarity, trend, and seasonality. Participants learn about techniques to identify these characteristics in a given dataset.

### Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation, which measures the similarity between observations at different time lags, is explored in detail. Participants learn how to calculate autocorrelation and its relevance in time series analysis.

### Seasonality

Seasonality in time series data is discussed, along with methods to identify and handle it. Techniques such as deseasonalization are demonstrated with examples.

### Stationarity

Stationarity, a crucial aspect of time series data, is examined thoroughly. Different types of stationary processes and models are discussed, along with methods to identify stationarity in a dataset.

## Implementation

The experiment provides both theoretical explanations and practical implementations in Python. Participants learn how to visualize and analyze time series data using Python libraries such as matplotlib and pandas. Statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test are implemented to assess stationarity.

## How to Use

To replicate the experiment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the experiment notes for detailed instructions.
3. Navigate to the `code/` directory and run the Python scripts using a Python interpreter.
4. Experiment with different datasets and modify the code as needed to explore various scenarios.
