# How to Identify and Remove Seasonality from Time Series Data with Python

This repository contains Python code demonstrating techniques to identify and remove seasonality from time series data.

## Overview

Time series datasets often contain seasonal components, which are repeating patterns over fixed periods of time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). This seasonal variation can obscure the underlying signal in the data and affect the performance of predictive models. This project aims to address this issue by exploring methods to identify and remove seasonality from time series data using Python.

## Aim

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide on:

- Understanding seasonality in time series data and its impact on predictive modeling.
- Implementing techniques to identify and remove seasonality using Python.
